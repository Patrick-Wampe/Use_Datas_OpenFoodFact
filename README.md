# Use_Datas_OpenFoodFact

Use_Datas_OpenFoodFact is an application whose purpose is to use the data of the Open Food Fact API to provide the user with healthy foods as a substitute for other unhealthy foods. This project is part of a learning path "Python applicaton developper" which you can find on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/paths/developpeur-se-dapplication-python) web site.

## FEATURES

    - create the database from a script (INI_DB.sql) at localhost
    - retrieve datas from Open Food Fact API : this feature get a set of datas from the API based on our config file, then process raw datas to extract what we need to finally insert it in the correct format in our local database. It only executes the first time we launch the program and then update at a frequency that we define. We will be able to force the update by adding an option at the launch of the starting point of the application.
